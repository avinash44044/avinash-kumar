coding Assignment


-All inputs are taken as strings, and then converted into integers inside the code.
For problem 4
-The input list (e.g., 1 2 8 9 12 46 76 82 15 20 30) is split and stored in an ArrayList<Integer> because ArrayList allows dynamic storage without needing a fixed size.
-To count how many numbers are divisible by each value from 1 to 9, a HashMap<Integer, Integer> is used.
-Java does not have a built-in dictionary type like Python, so a HashMap is the closest alternative.
-The final output is printed in a dictionary-style format to match the assignment requirement.
